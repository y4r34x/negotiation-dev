Seller will work full time until an interim workaround or a permanent resolution is provided. Priority 2 : A resolution will be provided within five working days. The resolution could be a work around, or some other interim measure, if that interim measure is considered acceptable. Priority 3 : A resolution will be provided in a future release of the product. Although Seller plans to resolve all problems in less time than the goals; some troubles will simply take longer than the guidelines due to their complexity. Seller will make its best effort to provide trouble resolution within these response time goals. In cases where there is a problem that is outside Sellers control, for example, a problem with the operating system, database software, or any other part of the system that is not part of the Software, Seller will not be held liable or responsible for the problem."
